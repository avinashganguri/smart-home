# Smart Home Energy Consumption w/ Time Series Forecasting

### Dataset Overview
The Dataset used for this project contains smart meter readings of household appliances in kilowatts (kW) taken every minute, along with the weather conditions. The energy data from household appliances and the weather information are provided and the household appliances connected to the smart meter, along with their retrieved data, are listed below:

- time
- use [kW] (Total energy consumption)
- gen [kW] (Total energy generated by means of solar or other power generation resources)
- House overall [kW] (Overall house energy consumption)
- Dishwasher [kW]
- Furnace [kW]
- Home office [kW]
- Fridge [kW]
- Wine cellar [kW]
- Garage door [kW]
- Kitchen [kW]
- Barn [kW]
- Well [kW]
- Microwave [kW]
- Living room [kW]
- Solar [kW] (Solar power generation)
- Temperature [Fahrenheit]
- Icon (clear-night, clear-day, rain, partly-cloudy-day, partly-cloudy-night)
- Humidity
- Visibility
- Summary (Clear, Partly Cloudy, Light Rain, Drizzle, Overcast)
- ApparentTemperature
- Pressure
- WindSpeed
- CloudCover
- WindBearing
- PrecipIntensity
- DewPoint
